This git repo is the source code for the second version of my website about me, this time with Javascript! Yay!

Before I created a static HTML/CSS website using Bootstrap, that used simple Javascript to display content, however
I think it is time to try something more scalable and multipurpose, which is why I am now moving to a Node.js backend
instead of a Apache httpd web server. The website will use the Next.js toolchain, as well as React.js for displaying
content.


Current Development:

Slowly transfering content from old HTML site to this site, now that basic layout is setup. Running into problems
with Next.js and React.js being picky about what type of HTML can be displayed easily.

Not sure how to display resume, might find a plugin for displaying PDF's than displaying the .htm file that I 
did on the other site.
