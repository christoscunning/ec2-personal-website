This git repo is the source code for the second version of my website about me, this time with Javascript! Yay!

Before I created a static HTML/CSS website using Bootstrap, that used simple Javascript to display content, however
I think it is time to try something more scalable and multipurpose, which is why I am now moving to a Node.js backend
instead of a Apache httpd web server. The website will use the Next.js toolchain, as well as React.js for displaying
content.
