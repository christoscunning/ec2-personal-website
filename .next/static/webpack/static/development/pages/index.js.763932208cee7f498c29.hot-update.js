For one, although the wiki holds a great wealth of, having information displayed in a more accessible way on our website could help those not has familiar with the internal workings of the EUS. Something like a quick FAQ page, (ex: What is a committee? What is council?) or a page for the Board to display completed and in progress mandates could be informative and provide insight to students of what the EUS actually does. Although the EUS also uses listservs and Facebook as forms of communication, these often can get lost in the mass amount of emails and Facebook events people get invited to. Turning the McGill EUS website into a sort of hub of information would allow students to reach out and learn more about specific parts of the society they are involved with instead of getting a list of things each week that they might be interested in. I believe that it is crucial that we expand upon it to more effectively reach members of the EUS."));
