I have experience creating and hosting websites, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I have hosted using AWS. I believe this technical experience will allow me to quickly learn how the EUS system operates and how I can implement ideas to improve it. I also have experience with handling computer hardware and assembling computer components. I also created this website using Node.js and React.js!\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\tWhat other experience or skills do you have that will help you succeed in the role(s) you selected?\r\n\t\t</h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAside from technical experience, I have served as a member of the EUS Board of Governors as a Member at Large, as well as ECSESS U1 Computer Rep. Positions such as these allow me to work with others to create something greater together, something that I am excited to do with the IT Committee. A big part of the above positions is collaboration with others, something that will translate easily to any role on the IT Committee.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\nexport default withLayout(Page)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA3BA;AACA;AAgCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
